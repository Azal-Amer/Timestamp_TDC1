This is the basic set of Python script that uses Tkinter GUI based on the code written from the Quantum Optics Lab.
Packages used:
 - Numpy
 - Matplotlib
 - Pyserial
 - Tkinter (Note you need to use sudo apt-get install python3-tk in Linux)
 
 They work cross platform provided you set the right serial port for the USB device. The device path can be modified in
 usbcount_class with notes of how to get them across platform. In due time, this can be upgraded to automatically detect the OS.
 
 Counter_FPGA_GUI is a script that works in PAIRS mode, giving counter values of each channel plus conincident events counts.
 The signal type is TTL by default, please update this script with 'ttl' or 'nim' string at the start of the script.
 
 timestamp_FPGA is a simple script that allows user to select integration time, and save a file called test.dat with the parsed
 timestamps. This script can be upgraded to provide user-defined file path, and in future continuous appending of timestamps for
 continuous reads.
 
 usbcount_class provides the basic functions needed for the GUI to work, this has some legacy code inside that is commented.
 
 serial_device provides the serial interface for the read and write commands.
 
 Debug Scripts:
 testSerial is a script to check if serial port path is correct.
